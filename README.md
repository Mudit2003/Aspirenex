# Customer Churn Prediction and Handwritten Text Recognition Project

This repository contains two modules developed as part of an assignment project at AspireNex: Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HR).

## Customer Churn Prediction (CCP)

CCP module predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)).

### Handwritten Text Recognition
The HR module focuses on recognizing handwritten text using a Telco Handwriting Dataset from Kaggle([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landlord/handwriting-recognition/data)). It involves preprocessing images, building an OCR model using ResNet50, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance.

### Jupyter Notebooks
Both the modules contain jupyter notebooks that contain the complete ideation , testing and playground while the final model is laid in the code.
